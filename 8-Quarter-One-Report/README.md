Exercise 8: Calculating Profit Margins and Revenue
Overview
This exercise focused on constructing and managing financial calculations in Microsoft Excel to determine revenue, costs, profit, and gross profit margin. You applied various single-step and multi-step formulas to perform detailed financial analyses.

Purpose
The objective was to:

Calculate purchase costs, shipping costs, and total costs for inventory items.
Determine revenue and profit margins.
Create a gross profit margin formula to assess financial performance.
Tasks Performed
Calculate Purchase Costs:
Multiplied the wholesale cost by the quantity purchased.
Determine Shipping Costs:
Used a fixed shipping rate for each item and applied it to quantities purchased.
Compute Total Costs:
Added purchase costs and shipping costs.
Set Retail Prices:
Applied a markup percentage to wholesale costs, considering shipping costs, to set the retail price.
Calculate Revenue and Profit:
Computed revenue by multiplying the retail price by items sold.
Calculated profit as the difference between revenue and total costs.
Gross Profit Margin:
Calculated gross profit margin as a percentage of total revenue.
Key Formulas Used
Purchase Cost: =E4*F4 (Wholesale cost multiplied by quantity purchased)
Shipping Cost: =F4*$P$1 (Quantity purchased multiplied by the shipping rate in cell P1)
Total Cost: =G4+H4 (Purchase cost plus shipping cost)
Retail Price: =(E4+$P$1)*1.5 (Wholesale cost plus shipping cost, marked up by 50%)
Revenue: =K4*J4 (Items sold multiplied by retail price)
Profit: =L4-I4 (Revenue minus total costs)
Gross Profit Margin: =(L201-I201)/L201 (Total revenue minus total costs, divided by total revenue)
Process Summary
Created formulas for purchase costs, shipping costs, total costs, and retail prices.
Computed revenue, profit, and gross profit margin for individual items and totals.
Applied Autofill to replicate formulas across all rows for consistent calculations.
Verified results by cross-checking with sample data and validating formula logic.
